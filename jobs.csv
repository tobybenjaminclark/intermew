UNSW

UNSW is not like other places you may have worked at. Yes, we are a large organisation with a diverse and talented community; a community doing extraordinary things.

If you want a career where you can thrive, be challenged, and do meaningful work, you are in the right place.

UNSW has three strategic priority areas. Firstly, a drive for academic excellence in research and education. Universities are often classified as ‘research intensive’ or ‘teaching intensive’. UNSW is proud to be an exemplar of both. We are among a limited group of universities worldwide capable of delivering research excellence alongside the highest quality education on a large scale. Secondly, a passion for social engagement, which improves lives through advancing equality, diversity, open debate, and economic progress. Thirdly, a commitment to achieving societal impact and translation through sharing our capability in research and education in the highest quality partnerships with institutions in both developed and emerging societies. We regard the interplay of academic excellence, social engagement, and societal impact and translation as the hallmarks of a great forward-looking 21st century university. To contribute to this journey, UNSW launched its first EDI Strategy in 2015 and became the first university in Australia to establish the Division of Equity and Diversity in 2017.
